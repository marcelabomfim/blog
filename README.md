# My personal Blog

I'm using Jekyll with modified theme based on Akshay Agarwal's [Jekyll-Mono](https://github.com/AkshayAgarwal007/Jekyll-Mono)

In addition to creating the blog and exercising the habit of writing, take advantage to learn about static sites with Jekyll and I also intend to turn this blog into an open theme for distribution.
